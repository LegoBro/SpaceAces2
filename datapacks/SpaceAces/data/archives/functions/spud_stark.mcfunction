At just the age of 5, he became a crackshot with it.  He later got a minirifle which he mastered almost immediately.  Noticing his skill, his father decided to send him off to the IGSR.  At the HQ, Spud became a Sharp-Shooter and eventually started the Sharp-Shooting League.  The SSL has become a very widely used sniping unit.","color":"dark_gray","bold":false,"underlined":false}]}
