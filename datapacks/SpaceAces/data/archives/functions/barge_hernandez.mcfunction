An olympic event is hosted every 3 years between the planets Vesna and Sheridan.  Barge was chosen for the arena event.  While being dropped off by a S-Viper III he ripped the wing cannon off the ship.  His opponent, Reginald copied Barge for a fair game.  The crowds went ecstatic.  They dodged each otherâ€™s shots until finally Reginald landed a hit, leaving Barge to the paramedics.  Upset about his loss, he still thought he could beat his opponent.  He joined the Space Pirates, just so he could fight his old opponent, Reginald, and regain his victory.","color":"dark_purple","bold":false,"underlined":false}]}
