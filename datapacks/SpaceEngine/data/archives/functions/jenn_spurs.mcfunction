However, Howard Barton, a scientist from the IGSR, created a special treatment for her condition.  It worked very well, so well her eyesight actually is superior to that of a normal person.  Sadly, the treatment had a major side affect; she forgot many major memories in her life.  Howard classified it as Large Memory Loss (LML).  Jenn eventually ran away.
